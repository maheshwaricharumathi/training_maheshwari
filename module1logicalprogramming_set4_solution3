3.Example is designed to compute the area of a triangle, given its width
and height. For some strange reason, the compiler refuses to believe that we declared thevariable width. The declaration is right there on line two, just after the definition of
height. Why isn't the compiler seeing it?
#include <iostream.h>
int height; /* the height of the triangle
int width; /* the width of the triangle */
int area; /* area of the triangle (computed) */
main()
{
cout << "Enter width height? ";
cin >> width >> height;
area = (width * height) / 2;
cout << "The area is " << area << '\n';
return (0);
}
EXPLANATION:
	In this program,The compiler consider the second line width as continues of first comment line.
becuase the first comment line statement not closed so,the compiler refuses to believe that we declared the variable width.
