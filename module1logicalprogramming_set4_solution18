18.	The following program tells us we have an undefined variable, but our only variable name is counter. Why?
#include <iostream.h>
#define RECIPROCAL (number) (1.0 / (number))
main()
}
float counter;
for (counter = 0.0; counter < 10.0;
counter += 1.0)
cout << "1/" << counter << " = "<<
RECIPROCAL(counter) << "\n";
}
return (0);
}

EXPLANATION:
	In this program we have the undefined variable number because in macro function we used the space between the 
RECIPROCAL and number it is  syntax error,so the compiler do not consider the number as variable.
