9.	How will you change the program to print ch as int?
#include <iostream.h>
signed char ch; // Very short integer
// Range is -128 to 127
int main()
{
ch = 37;
cout << "The number is " <<ch << '\n';
return (0);
}
ANSWER:
#include <iostream.h>
signed char ch; // Very short integer
// Range is -128 to 127
int main()
{
int ch = 37;//redeclaration
cout << "The number is " <<(int)ch << '\n';
return (0);
}

EXPLANATION:
	if we TYPECAST the ch  as integer value in main function then we will get the 
output as integer value.
