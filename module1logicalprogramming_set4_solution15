15.	This Examplecomputes the wrong valuefor size. Why?
#include <iostream.h>
#define SIZE 10;
#define FUDGE SIZE -2;
main ()
{
int size; // Size to really use
size = FUDGE;
cout << "Size is " << size << '\n';
return (0);
}

EXPLANATION:
	In this program it will print the wrong answer as 10 insteed of 8 because the macro function of this 
program declaration is wrong.(i.e)semicolon(;)

if we remove the semicolon in macro function the output will be size 8.
