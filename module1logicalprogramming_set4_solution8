8.	Is it a legal code?
size = 5;
result = ++size;
The first statement assigns size the value of 5. The second statement:
1. Increments size (side effect)
2. Assigns result the value of size (main operation)
But in what order? 
1. result is assigned the value of size (5), and then size is incremented.
result is 5 and size is 6.
2. size is incremented, and then result is assigned the value of size (6).
result is 6 and size is 6.
3. The answer is compiler dependent and varies from computer to computer.
4. If you don't write code like this, you don't have to worry about these sorts of questions.

ANSWER:
	2)Size is incremented,and then result is assigned the value of size(6) result is 6 and size is 6.
