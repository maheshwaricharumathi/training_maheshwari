19.	In the following program, the HIGH_SPEED flag works, but theDIRECT_CONNECT flag does not. Why?
#include <iostream.h>
const int HIGH_SPEED = (1<<7); /* modem is running fast */
// we are using a hardwired connection
const int DIRECT_CONNECT = (1<<8);
char flags = 0; // start with nothing
main()
{
flags |= HIGH_SPEED; // we are running fast
flags |= DIRECT_CONNECT; // because we are wired together
if ((flags & HIGH_SPEED) != 0)
cout <<"High speed set\n";
if ((flags & DIRECT_CONNECT) != 0)
cout <<"Direct connect set\n";
return (0);
}
EXPLANATION:
The DIRECT_CONNECT flag  does not work because the char range exit in the direct_flag,when we try to shifting the bits.
