7.	Why does the following program fail to print the correct zip code? What does
it print instead?
long int zip; // Zip code
main()
{
zip = 02137L; // Use the zip code for Cambridge MA
cout << "New York's zip code is: " << zip << '\n';
return(0);
}

EXPLANATION:
	The output for this program  new york zip code is 1119. it is  wrong output,because the assigned value is octal value  it is coverted to decimal value so,
 it does not produce the correct output for this program.
