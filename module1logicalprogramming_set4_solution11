11.	What is the error in this program?
#include <iostream.h>
/*
* This program produces a Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion
* chart for the numbers 0 to 100.
*
* Restrictions:
* This program deals with integers only, so the
* calculations may not be exact.
*/
// The current Celsius temperature we are working with
int celsius;
main() {
for (celsius = 0; celsius <= 100; ++celsius);
cout << "Celsius: " << celsius <<
" Fahrenheit: " << ((celsius * 9) / 5 + 32) << '\n';
return (0);
}
When run, this program prints out:
Celsius: 101 Fahrenheit: 213
and nothing more. Why?

EXPLANATION:
	Here,The for loop has terminated at end of the statement so it will execute only once after gets incremented as 101 so,
  it will print celcius:101 Fahrenheit:213 as output.
