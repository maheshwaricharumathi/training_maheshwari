10.	For some strange reason, the program here thinks that everyoneowes a balance of O dollars. Why?

#include <iostream.h>
int balance_owed; // amount owed
main ()
{
cout << "Enter number of dollars owed:";
cin >> balance_owed;
if (balance_owed = 0)
cout << "You owe nothing.\n";
else
cout << "You owe " << balance_owed << " dollars.\n";
return (0);
}
EXPLANATION:
	In this program, if statement  assigning the value 0 to balance_owed so everyones balance
as 0 dollars when we print the ouput.
