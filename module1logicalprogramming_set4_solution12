12.This program reads a list of five numbers and counts the number of threes and sevens in the data. Why does it give us the wrong answers?
include <iostream.h>
int seven_count; // Number of sevens in the data
int data[5]; // The data to count 3 and 7 in
int three_count; // Number of threes in the data
int index; // Index into the data
main() {
seven_count = 0;
three_count = 0;
cout << "Enter 5 numbers\n";
cin >> data[1] >> data[2] >> data[3] >>
data[4] >> data[5];
for (index = 1; index <= 5; ++index)
if (data[index] == 3)
++three_count;
if (data[index] == 7)
++seven_count;
}
cout << "Threes " << three_count << " Sevens " << seven_count << '\n';
return (0);
}
When we run this program with the data 3 73 0 2, the results are:
Threes 4 Sevens 1
(Your results may vary.)

EXPLANATION:
Here,The array values are start with  index 0,but in this program we are getting the input from index 1 so,
 it will print the wrong data's as output.
