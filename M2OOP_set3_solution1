1.	Briefly describe a possible collection of classes which can be used to represent a music collection (for example, inside a music player), focusing on how they would be related by composition. You should include classes for songs, artists, albums and playlists. 


Hint: write down the four class names, draw a line between each pair of classes which you think should have a relationship, and decide what kind of relationship would be the most appropriate.

For simplicity you can assume that any song or album has a single “artist” value (which could represent more than one person), but you should include compilation albums (which contain songs by a selection of different artists). The “artist” of a compilation album can be a special value like “Various Artists”. You can also assume that each song is associated with a single album, but that multiple copies of the same song (which are included in different albums) can exist.

ANSWER:
Class song
{
Public:
String Song_name;
String Song_artist;
String Song_album;
};
Public class artist:song
{
String artist_name;
String composer;
String developer_name;
};
Public class album:artist
{
Public:
String Album_name;
Int  Album_no;
String lyrics;
Album_composition;
};
Public class  playlist:album
{
String Playlist_name;
Playlist_mode;
};
