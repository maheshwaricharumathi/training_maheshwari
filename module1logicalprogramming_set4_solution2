2.	Why does this program print ''The value of 1/3 is 0"? What must be done to this
program to fix it?
#include <iostream.h>
float answer; // the result of the divide
main ()
{
answer = 1/3;
cout << "The value of 1/3 is " << answer << "\n";
return (0);
}
PROGRAM TO FIX:
#include <iostream.h>
float answer; 
main ()
{
answer = 1.0/3.0;
cout << "The value of 1/3 is " << answer << "\n";
return (0);
}
EXPLANATION:
 	In this program we get the answer as 0 because,The fifth line of this program we gave the  integer value divided by 
integer value directly,so we get the ans also integer.instead of this if we give the input as float values then we can get the float values as output.
