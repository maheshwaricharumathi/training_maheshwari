Write a simple program which loops over a list of user data (tuples containing a username, email and age) and adds each user to a directory if the user is at least 16 years old. You do not need to store the age. Write a simple exception hierarchy which defines a different exception for each of these error conditions:
•	the username is not unique
•	the age is not a positive integer
•	the user is under 16
•	the email address is not valid (a simple check for a username, the @ symbol and a domain name is sufficient)
Raise these exceptions in your program where appropriate. Whenever an exception occurs, your program should move onto the next set of data in the list. Print a different error message for each different kind of exception.
You can consider an email address to be valid if it contains one @ symbol and has a non-empty username and domain name – you don’t need to check for valid characters. You can assume that the age is already an integer value.



#include<iostream.h>
#include<conio.h>
#include<string.h>
Void main()
{
//Data members
String username;
Int age;
String user;
String emailid;
Int no_of_user,size;
Cout<<”Enter the no_ of_ user”;
Cin>>no_of_user;
For(size=0;size>=no_of_user;size++)
{
//getting user details
Cout<<”Enter the user name”;
Cin>>username;
Cout<<”Enter the user age”;
Cin>>age;
Cout<<”Enter the email”:
Cin>>emailed;
Try
{
If(age<16)
{
Cout<<:Exception occurred”;
Throw age;
}
Catch(int age1)
{
Cout<<”exception”;
}try{
If(emailidnotvalid){
Cout<<”exception occurred”;
}
Try
{
Throw emailed;
}
Catch(string emailid){
Cout<<”NoSuchFieldException”;
}
}
