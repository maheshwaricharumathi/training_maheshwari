2.	Explain abstraction for the following example: Implementation not required. 
You have an object Mobile Phone and have 3 mobile phones as following:-
N 142 (Features:- Calling, SMS)
N 271 (Features:- Calling, SMS, FM Radio, MP3, Camera)
B (Features:-Calling, SMS, FM Radio, MP3, Camera, Video Recording, Reading E-mails)
(Example could be in JAVA or C++)



ANSWER:
ABSTRACTION
		Abstraction means providing essential  data to the outside world and hiding the backround details.

 class  Mobile_Phone 
{  
Public:
    void Calling();  
    void SMS();  
}  
class N_142: Mobile_Phone 
{
}  
 class N_271: Mobile_Phone {  
   public:
      void FMRadio();  
       void MP3();  
      void Camera();  
}  
public class B: N_271 {  
    public void Video_Recording();  
    public void ReadAndSendEmails();  
}
In this above program the baseclass is defined as mobile phone and other subclasses are deriving the baseclass properties.
All classes are having the common properties(void calling,void sms).
