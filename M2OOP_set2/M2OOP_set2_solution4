4.A group of  geometric figures have a position and an orientation in a three dimensional space, and a function to drawthemself. 
   The geometric objects are: Point, Line, Plane, Cube, Cuboid. 
   Implementation not required
  (a) Draw a likely class hierarchy.
  (b) Write the base class with required attributes and methods.
  (c) Explain why, by using a base class and hierarchy, the process of including a new
   subclass, such as a Ellipsoid, is impressivelyeasy.

Class shapes
{
Area();
Volume();
Public class cube:shapes
{
Int x;
}
Public class cuboid:shapes
{
Int breath;
Int width;
Int length;
}
Public class line
{
Int x,y;
}
Public class point
{
X;
}
Public class ellipsoid:shapes
{
Int a,b,c;
}
Public class plane:shapaes
{
Int x[4],y[4];
}

The baseclass having the common attributes and methods.
so while inheriting the baseclass to the subclass the baseclass attrubites and methods can overridden in the baseclass so we can use the memory  efficiently.
