20.	In Example the first loop works, but the second fails. Why?
#include <iostream.h>
main ()
{
short int i;
// Works
for (i = 0x80; i !=0; i = (i >> 1)) {
cout << "i is " << hex << i << dec << '\n';
}
signed char ch;
// Fails
for (ch = 0x80; ch!=0; ch = (ch >> 1))
cout << "ch is " << hex << int(ch) << dec << '\n';
}
return (0);
}
.
EXPLANATION:

	Here,the second for loop  ch is declared as char but assigning the integer value so,
the second for loop fails.
